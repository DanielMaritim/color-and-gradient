# color-and-gradient

adding color on the canvas using gradient

The fillStyle property sets or returns the color, gradient, or pattern used to fill the drawing

The fillStyle option is a property, usually a string that is used to set the color used to do filling on the canvas. For example the fillRect() and fill() functions both use this setting to determine the color that they use
